This is a repository of deployment of  https://ping.pub .

## Are you interested in listing your blockchain on Ping Dashboard?

It's FREE, please submit a PR.

## Why does Ping Dashboard rely on official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers?
There are two primary reasons for this choice:

 - Trust: In a decentralized system, it is crucial to avoid relying solely on a single entity. By utilizing official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers, Ping Dashboard ensures that the data is sourced from a network of trusted participants.
 - Limited Resources: As Ping Dashboard plans to list hundreds of Cosmos-based blockchains in the future, it is impractical for the Ping team to operate validators or full nodes for all of them. Leveraging trusted third-party servers allows for more efficient resource allocation.

- **chain_name** the name to identify the chain on ping.pub, would be better to use the same one as registry
- **api** the rest api endpoint.(make sure that CORS is enabled: `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
- **rpc** the rpc endpoint, make sure that the port is added. rpc endpoint is only used for state sync. it's optional.
- **assets** Native Assets on blockchain. 

Endpoint providers will be listed in the "Popular" tab of the staking.

# Token Unit conversion

We have two methods to load token metadata for token unit conversion:

## Loading from a REST endpoint (recommended).
   
you can define the metadata in the `bank` -> `metadata` section of the blockchain's genesis file. if you don't define, the `[]` will return.

```json
{
  "name": "atom",
  "description": "The native staking token of the Cosmos Hub.",
  "denom_units": [
    {
      "denom": "uatom",
      "exponent": 0,
      "aliases": [
        "microatom"
      ],
    },
    {
      "denom": "matom",
      "exponent": 3,
      "aliases": [
        "milliatom"
      ]
    },
    {
      "denom": "atom",
      "exponent": 6,
    }
  ],
  "base": "uatom",
  "display": "atom",
}
```
